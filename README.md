# Tranpose-Matris

This program can transpose the elements of the matrix.

For example,

list[2][3]={{1,2,3},

           {4,5,6},
           };
           
           The above matrix after Transpose is
           
           list^-1[3][2]={{1,4},
                          {2,5},
                          {3,6},
                          };
